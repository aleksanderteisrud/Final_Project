        <h2 tabindex="8">Imagine living on less than $1.9 a day. Having to fight each day to survive. You can’t afford food, and you don’t have a job because you can’t afford education. The only people you can base your life on is your family, and the limited resources they have. This is actually the everyday life for a lot of people worldwide today. We’re living in 2019 and poverty is still an existing problem.</h2>
        <img id="povertyproblem" src="../Pictures/povertyproblem.jpg" tabindex="9" title="Picture: A family of seven persons who have limited with resources. They could need your help. They live in houses made of simple materials, and they'll never know when the next natural disaster will kick in." alt="Picture: A family of seven who's starving">
        <h2 tabindex="10">Every day we hear about children who have died because they couldn’t afford food. United Nations says; “more than 700 million people, or 10% of the worlds population, still live in extreme poverty and is struggling to fulfill the most basic needs like health, education, and access to water and sanitation, to name a few.” </h2>

        <h2 tabindex="11">Another huge problem we are facing these days, are the environmental crisis. Since the Industrial revolution, the environment has been deteriorating. We’ve built factories that emits lots of CO2, and we drive cars more than ever before. The earth is bleeding, and we have to do something about it before it’s too late. There’s a lot of changes we have to do, but even the small things matters and we can all help the environment in the best possible way by working together.</h2>

        <h2 tabindex="13">The group of people we target with this idea are mostly people in the countries where technology is very widespread, and poverty isn’t the biggest problem. The last couple of years we have seen more and more people willing to help out with the environment crisis and the poverty-situation. People are contributing by for example donations.</h2>
