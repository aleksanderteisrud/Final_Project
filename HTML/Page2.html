    <h1>PROBLEM</h1>
    <H2>Imagine living on less than $1.9 a day, and have to fight each day to survive. You can’t afford food, and you don’t have a job because you can’t afford education. The only people you can base your life on is your family, and the small resources they have. This is actually the everyday life for a lot of people worldwide today. We’re living in 2019 and poverty is still an existing problem.</H2>

    <h2>Every day we hear about children who have died because they couldn’t afford food. United Nations says; “more than 700 million people, or 10% of the world population, still live in extreme poverty and is struggling to fulfill the most basic needs like health, education, and access to water and sanitation, to name a few.” </h2>
    <hr>
    <h2>Another huge problem which we are facing in these days, are the environmental crisis. Since the Industrial revolution, we haven’t been very friendly with our environment. We’ve built factories that emit lots of CO2, and we drive cars more than ever before. The earth is bleeding, and we have to do something about it before it’s too late. There’s a lot of changes we have to do, but everything matters and we all can help the environment on the best possible way. </h2>

    <h2>The group of people we target with this idea are mostly the countries where technology is very widespread, and poverty isn’t the biggest problem. The last couple of years we see more and more people who is willing to help out on the environmental crisis and also on the poverty-situation, with for example donations etc.</h2>
